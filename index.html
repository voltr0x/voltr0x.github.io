		<h2>I am a second-year graduate student pursuing my Masters in Game Science and Design from Northeastern University, Boston.  As a child growing up in Mumbai, you could find me snugly lying in bed playing Patapon on my PSP. Fast-forward to today, I work on such games myself, which feels like a dream come true. As an engineer, I find it liberating to toy with the physics of 3D objects, exploiting the GPU for real-time graphics and creating open-world environments and character designs. It is fascinating that the phrase "Sky is the Limit" falls short when talking about the limits of video game development. If you can imagine it, you can make it! When I am not working on video games (or playing them *wink*), you can catch me working on my Ultimate Frisbee skills.</h2>

				<h2>VR Two-Gether</h2>
				<h3>A cross-platform two player cooperative game where players collaborate to solve puzzles based on cooperative design patterns. The game features balanced gameplay mechanics and VR/PC affordances to create meaningful cooperation between players and determine player preferences for entertainment and performance through each level's new mechanics.</h3>

				<h2>2D Game Engine</h2>
				<h3>As a final project for my game engines class, I was part of a group project which required us to build a game engine using C++, SDL2 and OpenGL. We also created 3 games using this engine - breakout game, a platformer and a 2D top down adventure dungeon crawler RPG game. This project took one week to complete, with an estimated development time of 40 hours, during which time I implemented input processing, 2D rendering, a collision system, and rudimentary physics on the game objects. </h3>

				<h2>Pong Clone</h2>
				<h3>As a final project for my graphics class, I enjoyed creating an old-school classic game using C++ and SDL2. This project took one week to complete, with an estimated development time of 20 hours, during which time I implemented input processing, 2D rendering, a collision system, and rudimentary physics on the game objects. </h3>

				<h2>Shoot the Zombies!</h2>
				<h3>A top down isometric view survival shooter where players have to shoot waves of zombies. The assets are developed on Blender which I have created for the first time, whereas the game is developed on Unity with implemented game play mechanics of levels (increasing difficulty with each wave of enemies) and power-ups such as ammo and health.</h3>

				<h2>Melon Smash</h2>
				<h3>A group of 5 students from all over the world collaborated to create a single-player tower defense game in Unity. The game revolves around a farmer attempting to preserve his prized pumpkin by tossing several types of melons, one of which deals damage and the other of which is used to lure enemies. We divided tasks according to our areas of interest; I was in charge of opponent AI, gameplay, level design, and game management.</h3>
