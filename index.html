				<h2>Shoot the Zombies!</h2>
				<h3>A top down isometric view survival shooter where players have to shoot waves of zombies. The assets are developed on Blender which I have created for the first time, whereas the game is developed on Unity with implemented game play mechanics of levels (increasing difficulty with each wave of enemies) and power-ups such as ammo and health. It is an on-going project and there are many design plans planned.</h3>

				<h2>Melon Smash</h2>
				<h3>Designed a single player, different kind of tower defense Unity game as a group of 6 students. The game features a farmer trying to protect his precious pumpkin by throwing different types of melons - one to deal damage and other to lure the enemies. The enemies are vermin which spawn in waves with increasing difficulty. We divided work according to our interests; I worked with 2 other of my peers on programming, one each on narrative, music and art respectively. We still are working on improving the game and adding new mechanics to it.</h3>
